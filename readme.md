# Benefits of using NumPy

1. ## Speed
   When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists. This speed comes from the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algorithms used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations.
2. ## Less Memory
   NumPy uses C language to store data in memory. It is also optimized for memory usage during runtime. NumPy arrays take much less memory than Python lists. For example, a Python list of one million integers takes 37.5 MB of memory while a NumPy array of one million integers takes 4 MB of memory.
3. ## Multidimensional array
   Multidimensional array is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes. The number of axes is rank. NumPyâ€™s array class is called ndarray. It is also known by the alias array. Note that numpy.array is not the same as the Standard Python Library class array.array, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality. The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:
4. ## Optimized for advance mathmatics
   NumPy contains a large number of tools and built-in functions that can be used to solve mathematical problems. NumPy is also very useful for linear algebra, random number capability, and Fourier transform functionality. NumPy is also capable of handling linear algebra, arrays, and mathematical operations such as matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, etc.
